**Image Quantization using K-means Clustering**

Image quantization is the process of reducing the number of colors in an image while maintaining as much of the visual quality as possible. This technique is often used to reduce the file size or for artistic effects, such as creating a posterized image. In this project, we use K-means clustering to quantize an image by mapping the original pixel colors to a smaller set of representative colors (clusters).
